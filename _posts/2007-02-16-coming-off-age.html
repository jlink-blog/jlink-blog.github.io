<p>It's a fact that we all are getting older, some of us are even getting old. Nevertheless, it came as a surprise to me that in my current consulting and coaching engagements I usually am the team's number two in the (decreasing) age rank. And well yes there really are in fact and absolutely developers and testers who have a full decade or more to go to reach my blossoming seniority.</p>
<p>David J Anderson talks about <a href="http://www.agilemanagement.net/Articles/Weblog/NewRulesforOldGeeks.html">New Rules for Old Geeks</a> and makes a very valid point that work environments and expectations have to change when workers reach their best years. I no longer want to spent my nights programming or removing bugs. I need a full night's sleep to smooth the wrinkles. And I want to spent more than just the weekend with my family. To be frank, <em>I</em> never wanted to work five days in a row in the first place.</p>
