<p>Last year I was program chair of <a href="http://www.xpdays.de/2007/de/index.html">XP Days Germany</a>. Although it was quite a success I wasn't really content with the old-fashioned process any more: submit session, review by commitee, accept or reject.</p>
<p>So this year's program chair Stefan Roock boldy took a new approach: <a href="http://www.conftool.com/xpdays2008" target="_blank">Submission and review</a> are starting from day one concurrently and - even better - any one can contribute in both activities. I'm really thrilled about that and hope it will show the superiority of the wisdom of the crowd...</p>
<p>Here is the CFS in <a href="http://xpdayblog.it-agile.de/blog/?p=129" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="http://xpdayblog.it-agile.de/blog/?p=128" target="_blank">German</a>. Come and meet me in Hamburg, Nov 27 to 29.</p>
