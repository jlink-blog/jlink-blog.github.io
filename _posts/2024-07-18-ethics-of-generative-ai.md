Yesterday I gave an internal presentation at [my employer's](https://heigit.org) on [The Ethics of Generative AI](https://johanneslink.net/downloads/TheEthicsOfGenerativeAI.pdf).

The slides are very dense since they mostly enumerate all the stuff
I've collected over the last few weeks. 
Even though I had been aware of most problems before, 
I was still shocked by the sheer amount of ethical problems that arise from using generative AI.

Therefore, my personal conclusion at the end is very clear:
Stop using commercial generative AI and speak out against it!
A bit surprisingly, most of my colleagues are on the same page.
