<p>I finally managed to put <a href="http://johanneslink.net/artikel.html#jenseits">all twelve articles</a> from my infamous series "Jenseits des Tellerrands" in the German <a href="http://javamagazin.de/">Java Magazin</a> online (as PDF files). It's a collection of articles written by diverse authors all of which try to enlighten the readers on things you wouldn't expect in a magazine focused on Java programming. A couple of the papers break the classical form of technical writing and engage other style of prose: <a href="http://johanneslink.net/pdf/Teil_6_JM_3_06.pdf">detective story</a>, supervision, conference call protocol, <a href="http://johanneslink.net/pdf/Teil_12_JM_9_06.pdf">plagiarism</a> of an existing novel and more...</p>
<p>For those of you who do not understand written German, "Jenseits des Tellerrands" means something like "Outside your own plate of soup".</p>
