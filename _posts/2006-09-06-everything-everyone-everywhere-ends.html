<p>I've stolen the title from one of the best TV shows ever: Six Feet Under. Although "Everything ... Ends" sounds like a truism, the way and speed at which things sometimes do end surprises me...</p>
<p>Being an IT consultant is sometimes hard. Customers often expect the utmost flexibility as for the time you invest in your current project -- <i>flexibility</i> being a euphemism for "working as much as necessary at the necessary time". The recurring problem is that the exact terms of <i>necessary</i> are never being spelled out, let alone negotiated with the consultant. It's taken for granted that the daily rate - despite having eight hours per day in the contract - comprises anything and everything and your soul on top.</p>
<p>Well, you don't have to give in to the customer's <i>pressure by obvious expectation</i>, but I wonder how many customers will "set you free" regardless of your competence and your contributions to the project if your availability time-wise cannot keep-up with the expectance. It happened to me recently -- although this particular customer would rate my contributions differently, I guess.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of this incident I tried to rethink and re-evaluate what makes my personal <i>work life balance</i> sane and sustainable. The result of this careful consideration was probably as surprising to me as it was to my employer: I quit my job more or less overnight.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> I am available for software development and alike.</p>
