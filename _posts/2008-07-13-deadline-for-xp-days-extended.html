<p>Stefan Roock, program chair of this year's XP Days Germany, <a href="http://xpdayblog.it-agile.de/blog/?p=135">has just announced</a> that the submission deadline has been extended till July, 27:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the open reviewing process has worked well, the program comitee will need less time for the final review.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is definitely right that opening the review process to all was a big improvement. I have two submissions in the run: "Behaviour-Driven Development" and "Test-Driven Ajax". Go to<a href="http://www.conftool.com/xpdays2008/"> http://www.conftool.com/xpdays2008/</a>, register and tell me what you think of those.</p>
