In the [5th part of the series]({% post_url 2018-09-06-stateful-testing %})
I have already shown the basic idea of stateful properties.
However, with more complex or even persistent state we have to apply another
tool from out tool box: model-based testing.

Since the approach requires a through explanation I put it
[in a place of its own](https://johanneslink.net/model-based-testing/).
All code and examples are
[available ready to try](https://github.com/jlink/model-based-testing).
