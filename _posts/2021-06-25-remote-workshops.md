Together with Peter Kofler, famously known as [Code Cop](http://blog.code-cop.org/) 
I will teach four online workshops on four different topics:

- September 13 to 15: [Advanced Refactoring Techniques](https://blog.code-cop.org/p/workshop-advanced-refactoring-techniques.html)
- September 20 to 22: [Introduction to Property-based Testing](https://blog.code-cop.org/p/workshop-introduction-to-property-based.html)
- Septemner 27 to 29: [Unit Testing 101](https://blog.code-cop.org/p/workshop-unit-testing-101.html)
- October 4 to 6: [Test-Commit-Revert and Limbo](https://blog.code-cop.org/p/workshop-test-commit-revert-and-limbo.html)

All workshops have been freshly designed for an online environment. 
They will be taught and moderated by the two of us, with a maximum number of 12 participants.
