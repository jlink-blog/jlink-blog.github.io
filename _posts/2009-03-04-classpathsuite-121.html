<p>In order to prove that gaussian distribution does not hold for the time between releases I've made <a href="http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.html" target="_self">ClasspathSuite version 1.2.1</a> available as of now.</p>
<p>Basically <a href="http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.html#classpathProperty" target="_blank">one new feature</a> got added. No bugs fixed since 1.2.0 beta - because no one has found any.</p>
