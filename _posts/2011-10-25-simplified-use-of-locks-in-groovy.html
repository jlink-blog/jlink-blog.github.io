<p>I am currently writing an article about the challenges and pitfalls of concurrent programming for a German software magazine. Since the magazine's readers come from all kinds of platforms and programming languages I've chosen <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> as a concise means to present my examples. Groovy - together with its associated library <a href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">GPars</a> - comes with good support for easy synchronization and locking (e.g. @WithReadLock, @WithWriteLock and @Synchronized). However, I do not want to introduce the concept of AST transformations so I came up with a new way of using locks in Groovy - originally motivated by <a href="http://chrisbroadfoot.id.au/2008/08/06/groovy-threads/" target="_blank">Chris Broadfoot</a>. Here's a short example:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>
class Shelf {
    final products = []
    final lock = new ReentrantLock()
    void putIn(Product product) {
        lock {
            if (isFull())
                throw new StorageException("shelf is full.")
            products &lt;&lt; product
        }
    }
    boolean takeOut(Product product) {
        lock {
            return products.remove(product)
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>It looks like <em>lock</em> was a new keyword but actually I achieved that with a tiny bit of <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/ExpandoMetaClass" target="_blank">Groovy meta programming</a>:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>
Lock.metaClass.useFor = { Closure operation -&gt;
    lock()
    try {
        operation()
    } finally {
        unlock()
    }
}
Lock.metaClass.call = { Closure operation -&gt; delegate.useFor(operation) }
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Now that I used it in a couple of examples I suggest it should be considered for inclusion in <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk/">GDK</a>. What do YOU think?</p>
<p>P.S.: Don't get me wrong about the usefulness of explicit locking. In most cases other concepts - like parallel collections, data flows and agents - should be preferred.</p>
