<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a conflict within the team cannot be overcome with goodwill or compromises. Something (or someone) has to give. This time it was me.</p>
<p>I wish Marc, Stefan and Matthias all the best for making <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit5" target="_blank">JUnit 5</a> a success. The project deserves to become the future of testing on the JVM.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong></p>
<p>I have been asked a couple of times if I'm worried about JUnit 5's fundamental design: <strong><em>No, I'm not.</em></strong> In terms of design and architecture JUnit 5 is headed in the right direction.</p>
