<p>Achim, a friend of mine, <a href="http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/4852">tells a funny story</a> about his experience with Deutsche Post and its standardized processes and procedures. Deutsch Post World Net claims to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dpwn.de/dpwn?lang=de_EN">the world's leading logistics group</a> so I guess that by and large what they do works in a reasonably efficient way. However, the bigger a company the more likely you will find it enforces useless or even dysfunctional processes and workflows.</p>
<p>One thing that strikes me is that, nevertheless, many smaller companies try to make a profit by imitating the giants. I liked what I recently picked up in a podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Large companies are successful not because but despite their size. Trying to be successful by becoming large is like trying to become an opera singer by growing fat.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven't managed to find the quote's original source. It MIGHT be Peter Coffee's <a target="_blank" href="http://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=113246">keynote</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agile2006.org/">Agile 2006 Conference</a> - but I'm not sure. Listening to what he has to say is worthwhile at any rate.</p>
