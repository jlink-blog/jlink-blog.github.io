<p>Today, I stumbled across <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a>, a website for publishing and sharing your presentations. I'm still not sure if giving all of my material away is a good thing, but I experimented and uploaded the slides of a lecture I'll be giving tomorrow at the <a href="http://fh-heilbronn.de" target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences in Heilbronn</a>.</p>
<p>Slideshare allows to embed a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jlink/testgetriebene-softwareentwicklung" target="_blank">show</a> in your own web page but somehow I just don't manage to do that within wordpress.</p>
