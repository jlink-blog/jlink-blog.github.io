<p>In the <a href="http://blog.johanneslink.net/2008/08/08/ajax-travelogue-part-6-mocking-in-javascript/">previous episode</a> you've learned why a mocking framework seems to be a reasonable idea even in a language that provides closures and duck typing. <a title="MockMe" href="http://johanneslink.net/projects/mockme.html" target="_self">MockMe</a> is such a framework. I started to develop it after fighting the usability war with the existing ones I found out there.</p>
<p>MockMe has two fundamental ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic granularity of mocking should be the function. If I want to, I can fake the behaviour of a single function without influencing the rest (of an object or a prototype or the global namespace or whatever).</li>
<li>Most of the time, <em>spying</em> is a better idea than mocking because it's simpler. <em>Spying </em>basically means that, instead of specifying the expected interaction with your <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mock</span> spy object before doing the test, you use the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mock</span> spy object to <em>spy</em> into the interaction as it happens and verify that afterwards. In that respect I borrowed heavily from <a title="mockito" href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/" target="_blank">mockito</a>, a spying framework that's gaining more and more attention in the Java world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the example from yesterday:</p>
<pre>  var Speaker = {
    say: function(msg) {
      alert(msg);
    }
  };
  var DoubleSpeaker = {
    say: function(msg) {
      Speaker.say(msg+msg);
    }
  };</pre>
<p>We would like to write a test for <code>DoubleSpeaker.say</code> to verify that <code>Speaker.say</code> is being called with the argument duobled. Using MockMe the test looks like this:</p>
<pre>  testDoubleSpeaker: function() { with(this) {
    mock(Speaker).andDo(function() {
        DoubleSpeaker.say('oops');
        verify(Speaker.say)('oopsoops');
    });
  }},</pre>
<p>That's fairly easy, isn't it. It has only a third of the lines compared to the <a href="http://blog.johanneslink.net/2008/08/08/ajax-travelogue-part-6-mocking-in-javascript#longTest">hand-crafted version</a>. </p>
<p>There are mainly two reasons I prefer spying over mocking: (a) It does not break the standard testing flow of setup -&gt; test -&gt; assert. (b) It's harder to <em>overspecify</em> your implementation's behaviour. </p>
<p>The difference between spying and mocking has been described by Gerard Meszaros in his <a title="xUnit Test Patterns" href="http://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley/dp/0131495054" target="_blank">book on test patterns</a>. Among many other valuable contributions he succeeds in sorting out the differences in the terms used by different writers. That said, I still call MockMe a mocking framework for the selfish reason that mock has become the term that is being used most in the agile testing community.</p>
<p>To wrap up, the next example demonstrates that stubbing with MockMe is equally straightforward:</p>
<pre>  testStubbing: function() { with(this) {
    useMockerFor(function(mocker) {
      var f = mocker.mock();
      when(f)(1, 'two').thenReturn('hiho');
      assertEqual('hiho', f(1, 'two'));
    });
  }}</pre>
