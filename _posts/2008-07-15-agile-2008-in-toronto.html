<p>This year's <a href="http://www.agile2008.org" target="_blank">Agile conference</a> is looming quite large. I'm going to give a talk on "<a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/3070" target="_blank">Test-Driven Ajax</a>" on August, 5. That's the good news and I'm looking very much forward to it. The bad news: There are 44 <a href="http://www.agile2008.org/program-day2slot2.html" target="_blank">parallel sessions</a> and I'll have to compete with people like Mary Poppendieck, Dierk Riehle, James Newkirk, Dan North, Lisa Crispin, Brian Foote, Marc Evers, Mike Hill, Luke Hohman, Jutta Eckstein and Doug Rosenberg - just to name a few.</p>
<p>So, if you want to keep me away from lonesome talker's depression just drop by in Sheraton Hall B and we both will have a good talk about the weather or alike.</p>
