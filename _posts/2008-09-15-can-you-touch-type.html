<p>Well, I can't. That's why it struck a chord with me when I read <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html" target="_blank">Steve Yegge's rant</a> about those developers who claim that typing is not really important for fluent programming. The article is a very funny read and it left me determined to learn touch typing now - not today, but tomorrow - or maybe the year after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend a good touch typing teaching software in German?</p>
