<p>... but a giant leap for dotnetkind.</p>
<p>Via <a title="Hallelujah - ReSharper has Inline Method" href="http://trgoodwin.blogspot.com/2008/04/hallelujah-resharper-40-has-inline.html" target="_blank">Tim Goodwin</a> I learned that ReSharper 4.0 will have the <em>Inline Method</em> refactoring built in. I've never really understood why such an important refactoring atom had to wait sooooo long to be implemented. A lot of neat tricks can be done with it.</p>
