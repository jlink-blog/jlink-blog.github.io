Test-Driven development is a technique that's mostly being practiced within
the object-oriented development community. I've done and teached TDD in
many contexts over the last 15+ years but all of it in OO-centric codebases.

Since I'm personally very much interested in functional programming but have
never done production stuff with it, I'm eager to learn *how* TDD can be
transferred to the realm of Haskell, Clojure, F# and others or *if* that
should be a goal at all.

Therefore, I'm planning to organize a workshop for people who want to explore:

- If TDD is still a worthwhile approach when doing functional programming.
- How the benefits of TDD - like quick feedback, regression testing and
  incremental design - can be achieved by alternative techniques - e.g.
  REPL-driven development, type inference, Yupiter iBooks and other stuff.
- If functional style programming should change the way we develop and test-drive
  code in more classical OO environments.

### Basic Parameters:
- The workshop will be 3 days.
- It's completely non-profit.
- Attendees pay for their own travel and accomodation.
- Common costs for room, tech and food will equally be shared;
  I estimate 50 to 70 â‚¬ per day and person.
- All attendees will create the workshop "program" together. I'll try to arrange some
  sessions beforehand so that we have something to start with.
- No restriction on programming languages or IDEs.
- There's no required knowledge but a strong interest in FP and TDD is assumed.
- I assume a max of 20 attendees. Beyond that selection will mainly be done
  on a come-first, serve-first basis.

The workshop will take place in Heidelberg, Germany, or nearby.
I have two alternative dates to offer:
- June 27 to 29
- ~~July 4 to 6~~

If you are interested to attend _[send me an email](mailto:business@johanneslink.net?subject=Functional TDD Workshop)_
with your choice(s) of dates, as well as your experiences and interests considering
the workshop topic "TDD with functional programming". Feel free to suggests
workshop sessions, execrcises and topics.

The decision about actual date and participants will hopefully be taken by end of March.

## Update:

The date has been fixed: **June 27 to 29, 2017**

Location: [Holiday Inn Heidelberg City Center](http://www.fmhos.de/de/hotels/holiday-inn-express-heidelberg-city-centre)

Costs: Approx. 150 EUR / participant (without lunch and dinner)

## Update 2:

There are two free spots. Please _[send me an email](mailto:business@johanneslink.net?subject=Functional TDD Workshop)_
if you want to attend.
