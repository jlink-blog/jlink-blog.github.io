<p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.parallels.com/" target="_blank">Parallels Desktop for Mac</a> comes with a feature called <i>Coherence</i>. It allows you to have MS Windows applications to be embedded in your standard Mac OS X desktop. Here you see Appleâ€˜s Keynote and Pages peacefully side by side with MS Visual Studio 2005.</p>
