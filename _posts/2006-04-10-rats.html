<h3>You might think it's over, but it isn't</h3>
<p>All garbage has been collected. The remaining trash has been swiped away. But the rats, after having being crammed like kings for two months, miss their additional rations. They somehow manage to enter garbage bins...</p>

<p>I concede that any analogy can be stretched too far; nevertheless I wonder what's the counterpart of rats in software systems which have seemingly been cleaned up and be ridden of all garbage? Maybe it's us - the consultants - who won't just leave voluntarily when we've fulfilled our task. Not until we are served a poisonous diet.</p>
