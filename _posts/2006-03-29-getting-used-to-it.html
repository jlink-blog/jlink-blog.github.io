<p>After 8 weeks of strike, the garbage collection service is supposed to pick up refuse today:</p>

<p>I must confess that I sort of got used to stumble over garbage everywhere: In the street, in our backyard, in the stairway and even on our balcony. I hardly realized it any more. That's probably similar in the world of software but there's one difference:</p>
<p><i>Chances are very high that no one will ever dispose of the garbage in code and design which we have piled up for longer than a few days.<i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Many times we even manage to forget that it's garbage in the first place... until the pile of rubbish will eventually collapse.</i></i></p>
