Kotlin is currently the most hyped language on the JVM. With good reason.
The language is largely compatible with Java and comes with a nice set of features
to make programming on the JVM less burdensome and more functional.

However, there is not much coverage of Property-based Testing (PBT) focusing on Kotlin.
[This article](https://johanneslink.net/property-based-testing-in-kotlin/)
wants to fill the gap a little bit.
It covers the application of PBT in Kotlin using jqwik and jqwikâ€™s
[Kotlin module](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#kotlin-module).
