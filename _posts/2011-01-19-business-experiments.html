<p>I'm currently running a triple experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first time in my career I'm trying to organize a public workshop completely on my own. The topic is <a href="http://www.johanneslink.net/advancedTdd.jsp">Advanced TDD</a> and I'm very thrilled about the simulations and exercices I want to do there. The first run will be in German.</li>
<li>I'm <a href="http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120673690452">auctioning one of the seats</a> for this workshop on ebay. Let's see how this turns out.</li>
<li>Since I'm very eager to reach the minimum participation of 4 as soon as possible, I'll give a commission of 20 percent to anyone who'll send me a customer until 4 seats are taken. Just tell the interested person to refer to you when they <a href="mailto:workshop@johanneslink.net?subject=Workshop: Fortgeschrittene Testgetriebene Entwicklung">contact me</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
The first auction ended at 401 EUR. So I <a href="http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120678057429">started a second one which resulted in 512 EUR. Not bad I'd say.</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong><br />
I'm sold out 6 weeks in advance. </p>
