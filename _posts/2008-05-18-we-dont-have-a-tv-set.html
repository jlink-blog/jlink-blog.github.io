<p>That sentence used to be one that I've let slip quite a few times during the last 8 years or so. Depending on who I was talking to it either trickered an awestruck gaze telling me "That's a real man! How can he possibly spend his evenings and weekends without falling dead from boredom?" Or the other person would just respond: "We don't have one either. How can other people possibly spend their evenings and weekends watching TV?"</p>
<p>To be frank, claiming not to watch TV has stopped feeling right for me. Not that we have a TV set now, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>I spend most of my "working" time online - checking news, mails, feeds, forums etc</li>
<li>I manage to get the most recent episodes of my favourite TV shows as soon as they are available somewhere (don't ask!). And I do watch them every other night.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why Paul Graham really struck a chord with me when I read <a title="Disconnecting Distractions" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html" target="_blank">his most recent essay on Distractions</a>.</p>
<p>I now have to confess: <em>I'm an addict to new media and high-tec distractions</em>.</p>
