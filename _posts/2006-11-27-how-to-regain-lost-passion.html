<p><a href="http://www.xpdays.de" target="_blank">XP Day Germany</a> in Hamburg is over. I was quite nervous about it since it does not happen too often that I'm being invited to give a keynote on any topic I like. So I sat back and reminisced about my former life as an Extreme Programming enthusiast.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I still <i>do</i> think that XP is the underestimated jewel among the better known agile methodologies. During recent years, however, my enthusiasm was replaced by a feeling along the line "XP is too good for this world". Sometimes the "too good" felt more like "too difficult for most organizations and teams". I felt this kind of disillusionment to be rather wide-spread - at least within the German community, of which many members are meanwhile content to be mere "agilists" instead of "extremos".</p>
<p>So I tried to put all whining aside and concentrate on how to bring passion back into Extreme Programming. My points were basically threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li> <i>XP has to change</i> because the world of software is changing at light speed. Technological explosion and the inevitable advance of multi-site development are just two indicators for that fact.</li>
<li> As XP practitioners we have to <i>concentrate on the human (and humane) side</i> of system building to be successful. We must become the cream of the crop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633323/" target="_blank">change agents</a>.</li>
<li> Let's <i>restart to be extreme</i>. Just saying what we think is right won't be enough, we have to live up to our beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I don't think it's enough to be agile. You can listen to the full talk and see the slides <a href="http://johanneslink.net/xpday/keynote2006.html">on this screencast</a>.   Be warned: it's in German and sound quality is not as good as it should be.</p>
