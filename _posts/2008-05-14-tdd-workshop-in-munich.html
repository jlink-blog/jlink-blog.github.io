<p>If you have been planning to get some TDD teaching you might consider to come to Munich on June 9 &amp; 10 and attend my workshop on <a title="TDD with C#" href="http://entwickler-akademie.de/ak/psecom,id,23,seminar,56.html" target="_blank">TDD with C#</a>. The course is supposed to be in German but I will do it in English if necessary.</p>
<p>There are a couple of seats available; you'll get special conditions if you book via me. Just <a href="mailto:business@johanneslink.net">drop me a mail</a>.</p>
