In software development, we use lots of analogies.
Finding a good one can be crucial, when trying to explain a concept to people that are not familiar with it.
But analogies are also dangerous. They can lead to wrong conclusions.
To paraphrase a [common aphorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong):
"All analogies are wrong, but some are useful".

One of my favourite analogies when dealing with team work and team dynamics is _team sports_.
I use it to communicate basic ideas about Agile team work to those 
who tend to look at software development as mostly an individual activity. 
Let's see how far this analogy can carry us and where it breaks down.

## Individuals are overrated

What have Luka Dončić, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokić in common?
    They were rated as 3 of the 5 best NBA players. But none got into semi-finals of Eurobasket.

10x players can win a game, but don't win tournaments.
    A team of super-devs that don't want to collaborate only get so far.    

All players must be present to play a match.
    Not willing to share time, rules and (collaboration) space with you colleagues 
    -> You're not playing in a team

Different rules, different sport. (eg. NBA vs FIBA)
    You can only program on your machine, with your keyboard, with your favourite tool, at your preferred time-slots
    -> You're in a different game - and don't expect the same outcome

You have to agree on what kind of match you're in:
1 on 1, 3x3 or Full-court 5 vs 5?
    - 5 people can cross a court much faster than 1 person
        A team can tackle more complex problems than a single person


Different rules on different levels of the game:
    - A team that never practices can win Kreisliga but not Euroleague
        Working on a small-scale POC or a highly-complex distributed domain?

    - Experienced players that know how to play together can compete in higher leagues
      despite being slower and less athletic.
      They also don't have to practice as much, because many things just come naturally.
        "Knowing how to collaborate" beats "knowning the lastest" tool every time - over a full season

The "material" (shoes, socks, or rackets) mostly play a psychological role.
    It's not about typing speed. It's not about three monitors. It's not about being busy in every minute. 
    Know your personal constraints, but try to expand them.


## You need different types of players to make a team

Some players score. Some players defend. Some players bring energy. 
Some players reveal conflicts. Some players moderate conflicts.
Some players cheer on the bench.


## Different teams for different goals

Are you playing for the numbers?

Are you playing for a short-term win?

Are you playing for the championship?

Are you building-up a long-term organisation?


## What is success in a team

Winning a single match. -> Getting a feature out
Winning a championship. -> Getting features out regularly
Staying in the league.  -> Staying in the market
Staying within budget.  -> Earning money
No injuries.            -> No burnouts. 
Developing players.     -> Happy employees. Little turn-over.


## The role of a  team coach?

Coaches and team managers are often at the top of a hierarchy.

Does the analogy break here?
