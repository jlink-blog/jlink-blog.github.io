In software development, we use lots of analogies.
Examples are:
- "Software should be like engineering"
- "Software architecture should be like a city"
- "We can aggregate technical debt"

Finding a good analogy is important, when trying to explain a concept to people that are not familiar with it.
But analogies are also dangerous. They can lead to wrong conclusions.

One of my favourite analogies when dealing with team work and team dynamics is the analogy to _team sports_.
Let's see how far it can carry us and where it breaks down.

## Individuals are overrated

What have Luka Dončić, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokić in common?

## You cannot play alone

## There are different types of players

## Different teams for different goals

## The role of a  team coach?
